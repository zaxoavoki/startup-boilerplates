# Startup boilerplates

I'm tired of doing the same thing over and over again. That's why I decided to archieve here all
project templates I'm actively using.

- simple-backend:

  This project is built with `nx` package. It contains `backend` package, which is literally the whole backend
  which uses the most popular tools nowadays, such as:
  
  - GraphQL tools (code generator)
  - Linting
  - Prisma with MongoDB provider
  - Sentry reporting
  - Firebase admin
  
  But if you don't really need `nx` or don't like it, there is no problem separating the `backend` package.

In the future, I'm also planning to add more templates connected to frontend and mobile apps.
