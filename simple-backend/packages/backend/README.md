# Simple backend built on top of Node.js

#### Used packages:

- Apollo server
- Graphql
- Prisma (mongodb)

#### Available features:

- linting (eslint)
- testing (jest)
- generating GraphQL types (graphql-codegen)

I have had a terrible experience with ORMs like Typeform or sequelize; they are overcomplicated and 
hard to maintain. They have lousy typing as well. That's why I decided to try the `Prisma ORM package.

As this template is oriented to helping quickly bootstrap the backend, I will use MongoDB and Firebase.
